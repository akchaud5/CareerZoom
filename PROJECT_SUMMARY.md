# CareerZoom - Project Summary

## Overview
CareerZoom is a comprehensive Zoom-based interview preparation platform that leverages AI, real-time feedback, and peer collaboration to help students prepare for virtual interviews. The platform provides realistic mock interview simulations with industry-specific questions, AI-driven voice-over technology, and comprehensive feedback on verbal and non-verbal communication.

## Architecture

### Backend
- **Node.js/Express.js**: RESTful API handling interview sessions, user accounts, and feedback
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database storing user profiles, interview data, feedback, and improvement plans
- **Socket.io**: Real-time communication for interview sessions and peer feedback
- **JWT**: Token-based authentication for secure user sessions

### Frontend
- **React**: Component-based UI with hooks and context for state management
- **Material-UI**: Modern, responsive UI components
- **Chart.js/Recharts**: Data visualization for feedback and analytics
- **Zoom SDK Integration**: Embedded Zoom meetings for interview simulations

### AI Components
- **OpenAI Integration**: 
  - Analysis of interview recordings
  - Feedback generation
  - Text-to-speech for question voice-overs
- **Custom AI Models**: Evaluates communication skills, technical knowledge, and delivery

- âœ… Backend routes for voice services
- ðŸŸ¡ Real OpenAI text-to-speech integration pending
- ðŸŸ¡ Audio streaming needs implementation

## Development Mode Toggle

To facilitate development, the application includes a toggle mechanism for using mock data versus real API:
- Each component has a `USE_MOCK_DATA = true/false` constant
- When set to `true`, the app uses hardcoded mock data for all features
- When set to `false`, the app attempts to use real API endpoints
- Currently set to `true` by default for easier development

## Technical Highlights

### Backend
- RESTful API design with proper separation of concerns
- Mongoose models with relationships between data entities
- Authentication middleware for protected routes
- Service-oriented architecture for business logic
- Socket.io integration for real-time communication
- OpenAI API integration for text-to-speech and analysis

### Frontend
- React components with hooks and context for state management
- Responsive UI design with Material-UI
- Form validation and error handling
- Real-time updates with Socket.io client
- Data visualization with Chart.js/Recharts
- Audio playback controls for voice-over functionality

### Integration Points
- Zoom SDK for video conferencing
- OpenAI API for AI analysis, recommendations, and text-to-speech
- Socket.io for real-time feedback and notifications
- MongoDB for data persistence

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term
- Enhanced analytics dashboard
- More industry templates and question banks
- Improved AI feedback algorithms
- Mobile responsive design optimization
- Additional voice customization options

### Medium-term
- AI-driven question customization based on user performance
